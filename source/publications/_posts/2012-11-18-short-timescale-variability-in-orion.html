<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I attempted to use TripleSpec finder / guider images to search for variability &nbsp;on short (~5s) timescales in the Orion Nebula region. &nbsp;This project was an offshoot of the related <a href="http://adamginsburg.blogspot.com/2012/10/using-guider-images-to-achieve.html">http://adamginsburg.blogspot.com/2012/10/using-guider-images-to-achieve.html</a>. &nbsp;I successfully matched the images using a particular catalog &amp; the ever-cool&nbsp;<a href="http://astrometry.net/">astrometry.net </a>with a great deal of assistance from <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~dstn/">Dustin Lang</a>&nbsp;and some from <a href="http://hoggresearch.blogspot.com/2012/10/time-for-astrometrynet-to-rise-again.html">David Hogg</a>. &nbsp;I'll post details of that process later; it proved challenging but will DEFINITELY be useful again in the future. &nbsp;Short story: I had to build my own indices, then fit twice - once for the first match, once after distortion was applied to re-extract the sources in the right location.<br /><br />Conveniently, one of the products output by the astrometry.net code is ra,dec locations and fluxes (background subtracted) for all of the identified sources. &nbsp;So, I used a simple script to match all sources within 2" of a known source from my input catalog and generate timestream data. &nbsp;It took about an hour of processing (nested for loops - awful, but the only obvious choice at first. &nbsp;Half of the time was probably file IO anyway).<br /><br />I now had a few hundred timestreams of Orion stars. &nbsp;At this point, I hadn't done any kind of quality control, which was obviously a problem because the Trapezium and neighbors were clearly saturated. &nbsp;Also, there are known hot pixels that will drive some stars into weird behavior. &nbsp;But I ignored all of that. &nbsp;All I did for quality control was reject stars with more than about 5% missing data.<br /><br />I elected to go straight for PCA analysis. &nbsp;I assumed the primary component (the most correlated component) would be from the atmosphere, which is almost certainly true. &nbsp;Subtracting that off (shown in the notebook linked below) left some clearly correlated components left over - some of these are instrumental, others are correlated backgrounds, others are correlated saturation levels. &nbsp;I don't honestly know what all of the components are, but I DO know that correlated components are very unlikely to be intrinsic phenomena - stellar brightness isn't correlated.<br /><br />So I tried to cut out ALL correlated components. &nbsp;However, I think in the process I probably removed any useful information - even un-correlated signal should probably have a high amplitude (if it's interesting...) that will get removed through the process I used. &nbsp;Nonetheless, I probably have some upper limits on the 5s scale variability of these stars in K-band. &nbsp;Not enough to do anything like asteroseismology, but it was worth a day's effort.<br /><br />Here's the ipython notebook (gist &amp; nbviewer) for those interested:<br /><a href="https://gist.github.com/4109329">https://gist.github.com/4109329</a><br /><a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/4109329/">http://nbviewer.ipython.org/4109329/</a></div></div>
