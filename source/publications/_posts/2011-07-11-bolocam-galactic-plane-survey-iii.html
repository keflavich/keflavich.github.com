All of the analysis work was done by Miranda.<br /><br />Because of Gem OB1's known distance (~2 kpc), it was possible to derive the physical properties of all of the 34 BGPS sources.  NH<sub>3</sub> temperatures and line widths were combined to measure total dust mass, density, and virial parameter.  This paper is the best characterization of "typical" BGPS sources, at least for the outer galaxy.</div>
