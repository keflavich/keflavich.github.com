I did this work with Toshiya Ueta at the University of Denver.  My contribution was azimuthally interpolating the 7 high-resolution long-slit spectra onto a 3-dimensional grid, creating a full 3D position-velocity cube.  I used <a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">the Perl Data Language</a>, which I have since abandoned.</div>
