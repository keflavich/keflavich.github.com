Recently (2011), it has become clear that "protocluster" is unlikely to be the right label for IRAS 05358+3543.  "proto-association" might be more accurate.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting result of this paper is the discovery that the central source is likely to be a 400-AU binary with two massive (>8 msun) stars at different evolutionary stages.  It is just barely in ALMA's range...</div>
