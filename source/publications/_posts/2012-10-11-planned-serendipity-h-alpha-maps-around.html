<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Plenty of O-stars have been observed in H-alpha because they're in star forming regions. &nbsp;But there are plenty of others - runaways and the like - that haven't. &nbsp;A survey of these stars may turn up nearby ionized features. &nbsp;We may find externally illuminated AGB stars, allowing for determination of their ejecta composition with diagnostic lines that are usually unexcited and unavailable. &nbsp;We may find bipolar ejection nebulae or planetary nebulae with peculiar illumination patterns because they are not centrally lit.<div><br /></div><div>A good starting point &amp; justification for this survey would be to estimate the chance of a coincidence (within 5 pc? &nbsp;10 pc?) of an O star and an AGB star given purely random sampling. &nbsp;Based on the detection of SBW 2 in Carina, I think the odds must be pretty good.</div></div></div>
