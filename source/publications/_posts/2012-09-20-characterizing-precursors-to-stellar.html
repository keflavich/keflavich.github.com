Bally, A. Ginsburg, J.-P. Bernard, C. Brunt, G.A. Fuller, P. Martin, S. Molinari, J. Mottram, N. Peretto, L. Testi, M.A. Thompson 2011   <hr> The paper includes a careful characterization of the properties of both dense and diffuse regions within the two Hi-Gal Science Demonstration Phase fields (l=30 and l=59).  It demonstrated that star formation tracers are more common at higher temperatures, and that IRDCs exist on both the near and far side of the galaxy, where the difference between near and far is around 5-7 kpc.  <br><p>I helped develop the iterative background subtraction method and contributed to the discussion and conclusions; most of the work was Cara's but my experience with iterative flux estimation from the <a href="code.google.com/p/bgpspipeline/">BGPS pipeline</a>  proved useful.</div>
