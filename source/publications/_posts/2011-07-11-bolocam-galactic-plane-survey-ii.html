As part of this process, I also made the noise maps that were part of the Bolocat process and did some of the by-eye verification work.<br /><br />Bolocat extracted >8000 sources from the BGPS using a watershed decomposition method.  Most of these sources have now been observed with the HHT in HCO+ and N2H+ to determine their velocity and kinematic distance.</div>
