[<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...530A..90V"> ADS </a> ] [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2254"> arXiv </a>] <br>E. van Aarle, H. Van Winckel, T. Lloyd Evans, T. Ueta, P. R. Wood, and A. G. Ginsburg  <hr> A catalog of post-AGB stars in the LMC, useful in particular because they are at a common distance.  Post-AGB stars are quite luminous (&gt; 1000 L<sub>O</sub> usually), so easily detected in the LMC.  <br><p>My contribution to this work was years ago; I worked on the <a href="http://sage.stsci.edu/">SAGE</a> project for a few months at the University of Denver with <a href="http://mysite.du.edu/~tueta/Welcome.html">Toshiya Ueta</a>.  I generated a catalog of post-AGB objects and an online catalog with automatic SED plotter.  It was a pretty neat project, but I left before I was able to convince others that my catalog was definitive; nonetheless it was eventually used in this publication.  As an aside, that was my first foray into data languages, and I ended up using the <a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">Perl Data Language</a> long before I learned of python and before I got a free IDL license.</div>
